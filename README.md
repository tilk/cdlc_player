# cdlc_player

This Android app is a player for [CDLC](https://customsforge.com/) guitar tabs in PSARC format, as used in the Ubisoft Rocksmith 2014 Remastered game.
Have you ever wanted to use your sight-reading skills on the go, without a PC, Mac or a gaming console? Now you can.

## How to use

You have to download songs from [CustomsForge](https://customsforge.com/) to your mobile device, and add them to the app.
You will then be able to play them.

The reader for PSARC files was developed using the source code of the [Rocksmith Custom Song Toolkit](https://github.com/rscustom/rocksmith-custom-song-toolkit) as reference.
